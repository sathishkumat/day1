Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
HTTP1:
    Developed by Timothy Berners-Lee in 1989 as a communication standard for the World Wide Web
    HTTP is a top-level application protocol that exchanges information between a client computer and a local or remote web server. 
    In this process, a client sends a text-based request to a server by calling a method like GET or POST
    In response, the server sends a resource like an HTML page back to the client.
    For example,
    GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
    This request uses the GET method, which asks for data from the host server listed after Host:
    In response to this request, the example.com web server returns an HTML page to the requesting client, in addition to any images, stylesheets, or other resources called for in the HTML. 
HTTP/2:
    HTTP/2 began as the SPDY protocol, developed primarily at Google with the intention of reducing web page load latency by using techniques such as compression, multiplexing, and prioritization.
    HTTP/2 uses the binary framing layer to encapsulate all messages in binary format, while still maintaining HTTP semantics, such as verbs, methods, and headers.
    This ensures that web applications created before HTTP/2 can continue functioning as normal when interacting with the new protocol.
    In HTTP/2, the binary framing layer encodes requests/responses and cuts them up into smaller packets of information, greatly increasing the flexibility of data transfer.
    Let’s take a closer look at how this works. As opposed to HTTP/1.1, which must make use of multiple TCP connections to lessen the effect of HOL blocking, HTTP/2 establishes a single connection object between the two machines.
2 Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

A JavaScript object is a collection of named values having state and behavior (properties and method)”
For example: Person, car, pen, bike, Personal Computer , Washing Machine etc. Take the case of cars. All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car.
objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
Creating a JavaScript Object
Create a single object, using an object literal.
Create a single object, with the keyword new .
Define an object constructor, and then create objects of the constructed type.
Create an object using Object.create() .
